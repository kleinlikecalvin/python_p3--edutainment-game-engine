# Edutainment Game Engine

An interactive **web-based educational game builder** built with **Flask**. Supports simple **flashcard games** and **quizzes** — a modular platform that blends **fun** and **learning**.

> Think of it as a lightweight, customizable Duolingo + Kahoot!

## Project Goals

1. Create a platform where users can play or build simple educational games
2. Support different game types (quizzes and flashcards)
3. Include a web interface so it feels polished and accessible
4. Let users save their own games, scores, or progress
5. Make it modular, so adding new game types is easy

## Features

- **Flashcard Game Mode** – Create and play flashcard sets to memorize key concepts
- **User-Friendly Web UI** – Clean, intuitive interface powered by Flask + HTML/CSS
- **Modular Game Engine** – Easily add new types of educational games (puzzles, matching, etc.)
- **Data Persistence** – Save custom flashcard sets using a database

## Tech Stack

| Layer    | Tools                             |
